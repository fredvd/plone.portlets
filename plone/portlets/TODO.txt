====================
plone.portlets to-do
====================

  o Design
  
    - blacklisting of portlets in subfolders to stop acquisistion of portlets

      -> make a folder non-acquiring
        - this requires a marker (interface? attribute?) that stops
           the default IPortletRetreiver from going up to the parent.

      -> blacklist specific ids (?)
        - this requires assignments to have ids that are unique among all
           acquired portlets
