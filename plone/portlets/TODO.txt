plone.portlets to-do
====================

  o Design
  
    - blacklisting of portlets in subfolders to stop acquisistion of portlets

      -> make a folder non-acquiring
      
        - non-acquire user (untick to get it back)
 
        - non-acquire group (untick to get it back)
        
        - non-acquire portlet (untick to get it back)

      -> blacklist specific ids (?)
        - this requires assignments to have ids that are unique among all
           acquired portlets
