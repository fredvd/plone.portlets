====================
plone.portlets to-do
====================

  o Design
  
    - security around which portlet renderers may actually be accessed
      (c.f. zope.viewlet.manager's implementation of filter())
    
    - blacklisting of portlets in subfolders to stop acquisistion of portlets
    
    - ability for IPortletManager.filter() to not consider invisible portlets
        (e.g. portlets with conditions)
    
    - assignment of portlets to anonymous
    
  o Tests
  
    - assignment to user
    - assignment to group
    - assignment to sub-context
    
    - registration of different IPortletRetriever 
      (dashboard use case, only get from user)
